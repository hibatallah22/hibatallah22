# Hi there, I'm Hibatalllah!

I'm an aspiring Computer Science student passionate about exploring the intersections of **AI, math, physics, art, and music**. I love building creative tools, experimenting with code, and learning how technology can amplify both logic and expression.

## What I’m working on
- Learning Python and building small projects that combine math and my intrests 
- Exploring AI concepts and algorithms
- Contributing to open-source when I can

## Tech & Tools
- Python, Git, HTML/CSS
- Beginner in python and c++
- Tools: VS Code, GitHub, Replit, jupyternotebook

## Goals
- Build a portfolio of creative coding projects
- Collaborate with other curious minds
- Study CS at university and dive deeper into AI and theoretical CS and game devollping

## Fun facts
- I think math is beautiful.
- I like turning abstract concepts into visual or audio experiences.
- I’m always learning—whether it’s a new formula, a chord progression, or a cool AI model.
